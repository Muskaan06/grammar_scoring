        "# Grammar Scoring Competition\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Approach Overview\n",
        "The objective of this competition is to predict a grammar score, which is fundamentally a **regression problem**. The chosen approach involves conversion of provided audio files to transcripts using a pre-trained ASR model name Whisper. This was then fed as the fine-tuning training data to a transformer based model named DaBERT for grammar scoring task.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Preprocessing Steps\n",
        "The initial preprocessing pipeline is designed to standardize the audio data before feature extraction:\n",
        "* **Package Installation:** All required libraries (`torchaudio`, `wordfreq`, etc.) are installed.\n",
        "* **Audio Standardization:** The core `load_and_resample` function ensures all raw audio files are loaded and resampled to a consistent rate of **16,000 Hz**.\n",
        "* **Mono Conversion:** Multi-channel audio (e.g., stereo) is converted to **mono** (single channel) by averaging the channels, which is standard practice for speech processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Pipeline Architecture\n",
        "The machine learning pipeline follows a standard supervised learning flow:\n",
        "1.  **Raw Input:** Audio File + Ground Truth Score.\n",
        "2.  **Audio Preprocessing:** Resampling (16kHz) and Mono Conversion.\n",
        "3.  **Speech to text:** The audio was then converted to raw text using ASR model name **Whisper**. The generated texts were saved inform of csv.\n",
        "4.  **Model Training:** Training the **transformer** on the saved text csv.\n",
        "5.  **Evaluation:** Performance is assessed using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.\n",
        "## 4. Evaluation Results\n",
        "The final results from the model run are presented below.\n",

Personally for me I have to take a coach to the airport. Five hour coach, long, grueling, tiring. And then there is the flight. The flight is not bad. The flight will take us to Mexico City, a beautiful place, also wonderful. I love going there. The food and culture are beautiful, rich, and not just Mexico City, but the entirety of Mexico. It's beautiful and diverse. I love ceviche. I love tacos al pastor, the seafood tacos. It's beautiful going during summer where it's warm and the beaches are delicious, and you can go for a swim, and a lot of people in the community is there, especially during sunset or sunrise over the beach. It's actually stunning.\n",
